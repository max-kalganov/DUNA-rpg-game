# DUNA game

A game inspired by Duna books. 
The key advantage - all NPCs are controled by neural netrworks and can interact with aroundings.

### Main story
You are a runner or a smuggler from one of the freemans sietches.
Your aim is to transfer some stuff around the Duna managing not to be killed by the way.

### There will be several version of the game:
_The first version_: Simple game with a limitted number of worms

_The last version_ 
- full worms lifecycle is calculated
- nature changes are calculated
- transport processing
- interaction with senders/receivers/towns/etc.
- suite, suit's damage processing
- ...


### Optimization
Add `day time` like a meditation in the witcher when your character is sleeping. At that time all world can be processed.

#### Make NPCs consist of two parts: long term actions, short term reflects.
Long term actions can be processed at `day time`. Short term reflects - while playing.

#### Or caclulate all the world interactions if there is no player, and then correct only some of the paths, which were influenced by the player.
